asdf
----

[asdf][1] is a CLI tool that can manage multiple language runtime versions on a per-project basis. It is like `gvm`, `nvm`, `rbenv` & `pyenv` (and more) all in one! Simply install your languageâ€™s plugin!

This will be loaded automatically if asdf is installed in `$GOENV_ROOT`,
`~/.goenv`, or `goenv` is on the path.
